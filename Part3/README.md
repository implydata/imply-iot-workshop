# Imply Polaris to rescue

### IoT Architecture using Imply Polaris

Imply is a managed version of Apache Druid, a time-series data storage and analysis engine with subsecond queries across data at scale. A combination of fast queries with high concurrency of real-time stream data with historical context ensures IoT applications have immediate access to all of the data needed to drive actionable insights. Imply is the easiest way to run fast analytics and fast aggregations of metrics emitted from sensors, a common use case across a multitude of industries.

This architecture describes how to route data from your IoT devices to Imply via AWS IoT Core. Implyâ€™s capability to provide subsecond queries across data at scale, high concurrency, and a combination of real-time stream data with historical context ensures that IoT applications have immediate access to all of the data needed to drive actionable insights.
