IoT Workshop based on Apache Druid with AWS IoT Core and streaming through Kinesis 

# Welcome to the Imply Polaris IoT Workshop

IoT workshop based on Imply Polaris with AWS IoT Core and Kinesis streaming platform

# Real World IoT with Imply Polaris, a managed service of Apache Druid

## Stream Vehice telemetry data to AWS IoT core and Analyse IoT Sensor data in Imply Polaris

Learn how to connect Imply Polaris to AWS IoT Core over MQTT and stream vehicle telemetry data from simulated sensors streamed through Kinesis.  Workshop attendees will learn about Imply Polaris, AWS IoT Core, IoT Simulator, MQTT, Kinesis, cloud storage, data analytics and visualisation techniques.

Follow the links to access the different sections of the course:

### [Part 1](/part1/README.md)

Provides an overview to the course, introduces the several building blocks of generating and streaming IoT telemetry/sensor data.  It gets you to setup the devices and stream the data through Kinesis, ingest to Polaris and finally visualize the data solving some key challenges in toy's IoT real time streaming world.
