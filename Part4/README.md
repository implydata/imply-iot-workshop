## IoT challenges addressed by Imply 

In [Part 1](https://github.com/implydata/imply-iot-workshop/tree/main/Part1#apache-druid-to-rescue) of this workshop, we stated few challenges that prevail in the IoT industry now, Some of which are addressed by Imply in this section. 

**Anamoly Detection** 
With the data ingested in Imply, we unlock several ACTs such as 
-  Fleet Summary
-  Troubleshooting of abnormalities
-  Detecting Root Cause and follow up steps

## Analyze real-time telemetry data with Imply Polaris  (35-45 mins)

[Steps to analyze](/Part4/IoTWorkshop-ImplyPolarisStoryboard.pdf) real-time data with Imply Polaris 

## Conclusion 

In this workshop, we utilized the Fleet Management use case of electric vehicles and we demonstrated on how you can use AWS IoT Core and Imply together to ingest, monitor, and analyze real-time telemetry data from your IoT devices to a fully managed Apache Druid service, without worrying about provisioning or managing any cloud infrastructure.
